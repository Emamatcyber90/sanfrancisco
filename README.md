# Ledger

A simple way to keep track of the financials.


## Instructions

 1. Convert receipts or reports to `.png` or `.jpg` which makes it easier to
    cover up sensitive details. And please do cover up sensitive or personally
    identifiable information.
 2. The file format for receipts or reports is `YYYY-MM-DD__hyphenated-slug.ext`.
    These files belong in the `/assets` directory of this branch.
 3. Add an entry to the balance sheet table below. Be sure to include
    transaction details including the date, a short description (linking to
    your receipt or report) and the amount.
 4. Finally, be sure to accurately update the balance column.

_Note: currency is in USD. Negative amounts are wrapped in parentheses._
